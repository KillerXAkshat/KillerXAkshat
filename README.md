## Hello folks,This is [Akshat][linkedin] (◕ ˬ ◕)

I'm a passionate self-taught full stack applied ML Engineer and a freelance software engineer from India. I like reading about human-centered design and user-centered approaches to build my products by prioritizing its efficiency and user experience. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the product which I used to build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love to explore how collaboration and knowledge sharing happen through open-source.
